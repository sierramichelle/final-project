Finals Week Mood

Finals week is **a lot** for me as I have four papers to write. I have written two of them, but one of those was twelve pages so that should count as more than one. I'm tired and all I want is to go home. The only thing I'm thankful for is I only have one test, other than this one, to study for. Otherwise, I think I would probably have a breakdown every day.
