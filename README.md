##Finals Week Mood##

Finals week is **a lot** for me as I have four papers to write. I have written two of them, but one of those was twelve pages so that should count as more than one. I'm tired and all I want is to go home. The only thing I'm thankful for is I only have one test, other than this one, to study for. Otherwise, I think I would *definitely* have a breakdown every day.

All I can say is at least my roommate has her cat up here! :heart_eyes:
